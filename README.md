# PCA-Implementation
Reducing dimension of data from 10d to 2d

Below is the problem that is solved in the code:

You are given a matrix A ∈ R100×10 and are required to run a PCA on this matrix.

Questions: 
1. Find the covariance matrix between the columns.
2. Find the two top eigen vectors after performing steps of the PCA algorithm. 
3. Find the eigen values corresponding to these vectors.
4. Transform the original data set using these principal components.
5. Plot the data along these eigen directions.
           
           
Raw form data is :
[18.94,12.18,10.48,0.68,8.61,8.23,9.59,6.86,9.78,7.61]
